		<h1>LiveSchema Doc</h1>


		<hr style="align: left; width: 100%;" />
		<p><strong>The LiveSchema can be installed on-site in customer's private network. Here is a short notice of LiveSchema documentation avaliable by request. For the "software as a service" option please contact us at <a href="mailto:welcome@liveschema.io">welcome@liveschema.io</a>.</strong></p>

			<h2>Roles and access permisions</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>There are 2 main roles of LiveSchema user interface. 
				<blockquote>
					Designer <br/>
					Watcher <br/>
				</blockquote>
				Designer - the user who is able to manage all the objects, links and properties. <br/></p>
				<p>Watcher - the user who is able to view, but not to change.<br/></p>
				<p>Each of the Designers and Watchers can act in domain granted. So some of Designers can create/change/delete objects and links in A-domain, some of them can manage B-domain and some of them can manage both A and B domains. The same idea is for Watchers. </p>
				<p>Admin - the user who can grant pemisions for Designers and Watchers.
				<p>Another levels of access are the system console and the superuser. The superuser permisions are required for installation and global reconfiguration tasks.  
			</blockquote>


			<h2>LDAP/AD Support</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol and Active Directory service are supported by the LiveSchema authentification mechanism. Admin user is managing object hierarchy access rules - Disigners and Watchers access rights permitions.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h2>On-site Deployment Requirements</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The system can be installed on both hardware servers and virtual machines.</p>
				<p>The recommended requirements for the server of the system are:</p>
				<blockquote>
					64-bit OS <br/>
					CPU — 2.4 GHz / quad core <br/>
					RAM — 4 GB <br/>
					HDD — 72 GB <br/>
				</blockquote>

				<p>64-bit OS for the server of the system is required. The following operating systems were successfully tested:</p>
				<blockquote>
					Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5+ / 6 / 7;<br/>
					SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 / 12;<br/>
					Ubuntu Linux 10.04 / 12.04 / 14.04 / 14.10.<br/>
				</blockquote>
			
			<p>The server can be deployed with as a set of Docker Containers, Virtual or Hardware Machines meeting customer infrastructure design.
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Interface settings</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>To change system title in web interface:<br/>
				 - create a copy of default settings file (if not created earlier):<br/>
				<code>cp /usr/local/liveschema/client/js/default-client-config.js /usr/local/liveschema/client/js/client-config.js</code><br/>
				- enter new title to the custom settings file (<code>/usr/local/liveschema/client/js/client-config.js</code>) as follows:<br/>
				<code>title: ‘&lt;your-new-name&gt;’</code></p>
				
				<p>To change LiveSchema color-map for all the system you need to change <code>/usr/local/liveschema/client/livescema.local/css/livescema.local.css</code> file. We can provide you with a set of color schemas or prepare an individual for you. The file change is superuser privilege.</p>
				
				<p>Note that you can style each of the object/elemnt individualy. There's a background image upload user interface control in each of the object properties. And you can style each of the object with custom pease of CSS through user interface control in each of the object properties. All of the user interface properties changes is available for Designer roles users only.</p>

				<p><code>/usr/local/liveschema/client/livescema.local/css/livescema.local.css</code> is customisation example is follows:</p>
				<pre><code>
	.state-{ID} {
		-moz-box-shadow: 2px 5px 10px {COLOR};   /* Object shadow color */
		-webkit-box-shadow: 2px 5px 10px {COLOR};   /* Object shadow color */
		box-shadow: 2px 5px 10px {COLOR};   /* Object shadow color */
		border-left: 5px solid {COLOR}; /* Object main color */
	}

	.state-bg-{ID} {
		background-color: {COLOR}; /* Object background color */
	}

	.state-bg-light-{ID} {
		background-color: {COLOR}; /* Object background hue */
	}

	.view-screen-element ul li.child-object.state-{ID} {  /* Children object color */
		border-left: 5px solid {COLOR};
	}

	.badge.state-{ID} { /* Children badge color */
		background-color: {COLOR};
	}

	.link-state-{ID} circle { /* Link connector color */
		fill: {COLOR};
	}

	.link-state-{ID} path { /* Link color */
		stroke: {COLOR};
	}
				</code></pre><p>where:</p>
				<pre><code>
	{ID} - state ID;
	{COLOR} - colors of object and link elements.
				</code></pre>
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Methods of control</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>There are a number of build in methods to control state of each object or link.</p>
				<blockquote>
					Process by name <br/>
					Database query <br/>
					SNMP Get <br/>
					SNMP Trap <br/>
					Program / script execution <br/>
					Ping <br/>
					Local port <br/>
					Remote port <br/>
					HTTP-request <br/>
					Configuration file / directory <br/>
					JMX-sensor <br/>
					FTP-sensor <br/>
					MQTT-sensor <br/>
					Binary protocol <br/>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The methods allow you to control an almost any service, application or network infrastrucure. For each of particular object or link Designer is able to set of "what is good and what is bad" condition in web user interface. </p>

				<h2>Application Programming Interface</h2>
				<p>LiveSchema RESTful API allows to create/change/delete objects and links, change its poperties and assotiated documents, change states to make schema color change.</p>

				<p>The system provides RESTful API to access to its functionality. API includes authentication, actions on Objects, Links and Classes and other functions.</p>

				<p>The documents describing all of the REST methods, their parameters and format of responses are available for customers.</p>

				<p>API uses HTTP 2.0, both unsecure HTTP and secure HTTPS (over SLL).
				</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h2>Associated documentation and properties</h2>
				<blockquote>
				<p>There's functionality allowing Designers to add documentation and properties descriptions to the element context. This means that each and any object or link can have assotiated wiki-link or pdf-uploaded and the document will be available for Watchers. Designer can set an option with a text to a link or an object. The text will be shown in the object/link properties to the Watcher. There is an option to map the text right to the schema.</p>

				<p>Those documents and links assotiated can be managed through API.</p>

				<p>As an example, you can map addresses of your elements on the LiveSchema. Those addresses will be shown right under the elements.</p>
			</blockquote>


			<h2>Audit and change log</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>All the changes are tracked by the LiveSchema system and can be viewed and anilised. Any modification is stored in assosiation with the Designer. And state change is stored in object's and link's state change history. Audit log and state change reports to be generated in future releases.</p>
